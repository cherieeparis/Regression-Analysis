Looking at coeffieient(bossemps), With 1 unit of independent variable bossemps (work relation) increase that meaning people are reducing their satisfaction on workplace relations, there is 0.4909 unit increasing in dependent variable stayorg3 (stay organization) which means people are more unlikely not turning down another higher paid job offered, with a statistically significant as pvalue is lower than 0. Looking at t score, t=12.925, from the normal distribution, we could know it has a significantly low possibily to have had happen by chance. It's reasonably unlikely that I would get a coefficient this large (in absolute terms) with a small standard error by chance.

In general, as the race categories go higher, the lower the score on education with coeff from 2.4831 to 1.9325, although they all positive number. Compared to the reference category, individuals in the race category represented by race_1 white have, on average, an increase in white child education level by 2.4831 units while holding other variables constant with a statistically significant, while for race_2 black group, an increase in black child education level by 2.1336 units while holding other variables constant with a statistically significant. Therefore, we could say with increased family's parents education level, the white child's education level will rise better than black child's education on average with the absolute term. "

Constant the marital, there is negative correlation between attend1 and relpersn. If people more tend to consider themsleves not being religious, they are more likely to have statistcally significant low frequency on attending religious service, reducing by 0.1963 unit, in absolute term. Constant the relpersn, there is negative correlation between attend1 and marital. If people more tend to be a non-married status, they are more likely to have statistcally significant low frequency on attending religious service, reducing by 0.019 unit, in absolute term. In conclusion, this regression model confirm my expectation that people who are married will more likley attend religious service also people who consider themselves as a very religious person will more likley attend religious service than someone who are not.
